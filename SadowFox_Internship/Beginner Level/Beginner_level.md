  * **Add Contact:** Store a contact's name, phone number, and email.
  * **View Contacts:** Display all saved contacts.
  * **Update Contact:** Modify the phone number and email of an existing contact.
  * **Delete Contact:** Remove a contact by name.
  * **Search Contact:** Find contacts by name, phone number, or email keyword.
  * **Duplicate Validation:** Prevents adding contacts with the same name.

#### How to Execute ðŸš€

1.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Beginner Level/SimpleContactManagementSystem
    ```
2.  **Compile the Java code:**
    ```bash
    javac SimpleContactManagementSystem.java
    ```
3.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    java SimpleContactManagementSystem
    ```
